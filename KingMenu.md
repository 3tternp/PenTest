# Phases of Penetration testing
### We are going to see these penetration testing phases in detail.

## 1. Planning and Scoping
#### 1. Define the purpose of a penetration test: Identifying which programs should be checked and how they should be tested


## 2. Reconnaissance of the systems that have been tested:
#### Identifying known vulnerabilities and checking systems for exploits

- examples of information gathering techniques:
    - Search engine querying
    - WHOIS or DNS lookups
    - Social engineering techniques
    - Tax records of the company and other public records
    - user accounts, Email addresses, and social media profiles
    - Port scans, ping probes, packet sniffing, reverse DNS, etc.
    - Shoulder surfing

## 3. Vulnerability Assessment and the threat modeling phase
#### In this phase, the penetration tester implements a probe on the target network,
#### gathers preliminary data, and analyses the results to determine exploitation routes.

- This phase could lead to insights such as:
    - serverâ€™s directory.
    - Open a secure connection to an FTP server.
    - SMTP access points that send error messages with information about the network architecture.
    - Probability to Remote code execution.
    - Vulnerabilities in cross-site scripting
    - An internal code-signing certificate can be used to sign and insert new scripts into the network.

Exploring data on vulnerabilities and developing a threat model


## 4. Penetration Testing
#### 4. The exploitation phase
A penetration tester uses automated tools to search target properties for vulnerabilities in this phase.
These tools usually have their own files that provide information about the most common vulnerabilities.
Performing the vulnerability in order to gain access to the target network or device.

## 5. Active Intrusion attempts phase:
Installing a governance framework and obtaining access to further networks
If a penetration tester has accomplished breaching the security perimeter or exploiting a target device, they can activate malware or some method to enable continued access, much like a real advanced persistent threat.
 on the target network

## 6. Post-test exploitation and risk identification phase:
Vulnerabilities and flaws in security mechanisms are listed.

7. Penetration Test Report
## 7. Penetration testing report preparation:
Creating a report that includes a management review as well as technical information.

Python tools for penetration testers
====================================

If you are involved in vulnerability research, reverse engineering or
pentesting, I suggest to try out the
[Python](http://www.python.org) programming language. It has a rich set
of useful libraries and programs. This page lists some of them.

Most of the listed tools are written in Python, others are just Python
bindings for existing C libraries, i.e. they make those libraries easily
usable from Python programs.

Some of the more aggressive tools (pentest frameworks, bluetooth
smashers, web application vulnerability scanners, war-dialers, etc.) are
left out, because the legal situation of these tools is still a bit
unclear in Germany -- even after the [decision of the highest
court](http://www.bundesverfassungsgericht.de/entscheidungen/rk20090518_2bvr223307.html).
This list is clearly meant to help whitehats, and for now I prefer to
err on the safe side.
